This repository content have my capstone project. The project developed the following findings:

A recent initiative by a financial institution has recognized the challenges posed by the traditional loan approval processes, which often fail to capture the full spectrum of applicant profiles, leading to inefficiencies and potential risks. This project aims to address these challenges by developing a predictive model that leverages various features, including applicant demographics, employment details, loan specifics, and credit history. The primary objective is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of loan approval decisions, thereby reducing the likelihood of bad loans and optimizing customer offerings.
This exploration was conducted through the application of multiple machine learning models, including Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boost and Random Forest. The Random Forest model emerged as the top performer, achieving an ROC-AUC score of 82% and an accuracy rate of 77%. The analysis highlighted two critical features—credit history and income levels—that significantly influence loan approval outcomes.
The findings suggest that incorporating these key variables into the loan approval process can substantially improve decision-making, benefiting both the institution by mitigating financial risks and the customers by offering more tailored loan products. This approach not only enhances operational efficiency but also fosters greater financial inclusion, aligning with the institution’s strategic goals.
